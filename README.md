# Veteran Donations Predictions

This repository contains the implementation and analysis of predictive models aimed at optimizing fundraising efforts for war veterans' association.

## Project Overview

The project focuses on predicting donation behavior among war veterans to maximize fundraising efficiency. The datasets include demographic information, past transactions, and other relevant characteristics of potential donors. The goal is to identify individuals likely to make donations, thereby reducing fundraising costs and maximizing resources for charitable causes.

## Contents

1. **Introduction**: Overview of the project and its objectives.
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis**: Analysis of the provided dataset, including identification of missing values, outliers, and insights into key variables.
3. **Transformations**: Preprocessing techniques employed for handling missing values, outliers, and categorical variables.
4. **Model Training**: Training various machine learning models, including Decision Trees, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, Logistic Regression, ElasticNet, and Multilayer Perceptron, to predict donation behavior.
5. **Final Model Proposal**: Proposal for the final predictive model based on performance evaluation and comparison.
